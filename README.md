MY AIM, INTENSION, AND JOURNEY :-

Since I’m currently a beginner in programming, this repository will be updated regularly as I continue to grow. As I progress to more advanced levels, I’ll keep adding new projects and refining older ones — from simple beginner tasks to complex, real-world examples. I’ll also go back and improve previous projects over time, updating them with better structure, cleaner code, and more efficient designs. This way, you can learn the best techniques right from the start — and avoid the common mistakes and shortcuts I made along the way. My goal is to help you become a better developer from the beginning — by showing both my progress and the lessons learned at every stage.
